# FormBuilder Field Deactivate

Deactivate FormBuilder fields so they do not appear in the front-end form.

If you deactivate a fieldset then all the fields within the fieldset are effectively deactivated.

Deactivated fields are visible within the form entries, but have a "currently deactivated" notice appended to the field label.
